We successfully reached balena's Cloudlink (AKA VPN) at `cloudlink.balena-cloud.com:443`.

Cloudlink is a connection initially established by the device, but used mainly for the communication in the balenaCloud to device direction. Whenever you use the Dashboard to perform some action to your device, this command goes trough Cloudlink.

In other words, the network path from balenaCloud to the device seems to be working.
